-------------------------------------------
The safe way to backup is to run:

sqlite3 my_database.sq3
and then:
.backup backup_file.sq3


Result is copy of the database. It's different from regularly file copying,
because it takes care of any users currently working on the database.
There are proper locks set on the database, so the backup is done exclusively.
